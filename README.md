# coronavirusriskcalculator

This interactive should help a user personalize coronavirus in terms of their own health, location, and anything else that seems relevant.

1) Have a nice clean CSS.
2) Input at least 4-5 things from the user.
3) Output interesting info based on those inputs.
  3a)Which means we need datasets
    data 1) Covid Death case rate
    data 2) Preexisting condition case rate (We need to get data that says, ok if you have asthma, the death percentage is this)
    ??
    ??
    ??
4) What else can we do?

-   race/ethnicity/background of some kind? I know if you live in NYC its 2xhigher death rate if black/brown.
-   zipcode?
